Hey Ed ! Here is the assignement. 

You mentioned not to take more than a few hours so I did not set up a back end server and instead set up a static webpage with local javascript and CSS files. Simply open the file in the browser of your choice and it should work from there. I had fun with this and really hope to get some feedback on this from you.
