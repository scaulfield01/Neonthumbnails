Hey Ed ! Here is the assignement. 

You mentioned not to take more than a few hours so I did not set up a back end server and instead set up an index.html webpage with local javascript and CSS files. After cloning it down locally,  open the file in the browser of your choice and it should work from there. I had fun with this and really hope to get some feedback on this from you.
